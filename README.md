# MAE 211 Final Project - Saturn V Service Module
MAE 211 was an introduction to CAD class that I took. This repository contains my final project for this class which was the Saturn V Service module. This repo should contain all of the solid edge part files and assemblies for this project along with high resolution renders of the final project.

Renders can be found under SM/_Renders : https://github.com/SacredSqueegee/MAE_211_CSM_Project/tree/master/SM/_Renders

## Project Description
For this project I chose to model the Saturn V Command and Service Modules. After realizing the amount of detail I wanted to include on the internal structures I made the decision to only model the Service Module as I simply did not have enough time to model both in the detail I wanted.

While I kept all modeled parts in a 1:1 scale, there were quite a few "design" choices that had to be made to keep the project moving forward. This project was purely meant to demonstrate modeling profeciency using Solid Edge and not functioning mechanical designs. This pretty much means that the whole design is more of a visualization of the service module that's good enough to highlight its internal components/connections but one would not be able to re-create a functioning service module based on this work.


## Project Structure

<details open>
    <summary>Click this text to toggle directory tree visibility</summary>
    
    Old Parts/
        - Obsolete Solid Edge parts and assemblies that have been replaced in the final design. These have been
          kept around for future reference.
    
    SM/
    │   - This is the main folder for the project. This contains all the part and assembly files along with final
    │     renderes and the reference documentation used to design the parts.
    ├── Assemblies and Drawing/
    │   │ - Contains all the assemblies for the final project. Also contains the draft drawings needed for the
    │   │   final project.
    │   ├── Old Stuff/
    │   │     - Old assemblies I wanted to keep around for reference.
    │   └── Rendering Assemblies/
    │         - Assemblies containing the parts, materials, and orientation I wanted before import into keyshot
    │           for final rendering.
    ├── Center Parts/
    │   │ - Contains parts that go throughout the center of the service module. This contains the helium tank,
    │   │   internal bulkheads, heat shield, and service propulsion system parts.
    │   └── Service Propulsion System/
    │         - Contains all the parts for the service propulsion system, including: bolts, cumbustion chamber,
    │           skirt, plumbing, injectors, and more. This folder also contains the SPS assembly.
    ├── Coupler/
    │     - Contains the top parts of the service module meant for coupling it to the command module. Ran out of
    │       time designing the rest of the service modual so this is pretty bare bones.
    ├── High Gain Antenna/
    │   │ - Contains all the parts to assemble the high gain antenna on the bottom of the service module.
    │   └── Movement Parts/
    │         - All the parts needed to "deploy" the high gain antenna. This isn't a realistic deployment
    │           system and is only here to meet the movement requirement for the class.
    ├── Hull Panels and Hardware/
    │     - Contains the outer hull parts (The "skin" of the service module).
    ├── R-4D/
    │     - All parts, sub-assemblies, and assemblies of the R-4D monopropellant thruster system.
    │   ├── Housing and Housing Adapter/
    │   │     - Contains the R-4D housing part along with an adapter plate to mount on the final panel.
    │   ├── Mono Tanks and Hardware/
    │   │   │ - Contains the storage tank parts for the Helium and Mono Propellant along with bolts. There is also
    │   │   │   a sub-folder containing the assemblies for the tanks.
    │   │   └── Pipes/
    │   │         - Contains the different plumbing parts needed for the R-4D system.
    │   ├── Panels and Hardware/
    │   │     - Contains the Side Panels that the R-4D system(Thruster, Housing, Mono Tanks, Plumbing) attaches to.
    │   ├── Thruster/
    │   │     - Contains the R-4D thruster assembly and the individual parts that comprise it (Cumbustion Chamber,
    │   │       Nozzle, Connector, Mounting screw).
    │   └── asm/
    │         - Contains the base R-4D monopropellant thruster assembly. Also containse the full R-4D assembly
    │           mounted on a side panel with tanks and plumbing.
    ├── Sector 4 Parts/
    │     - This folder contains all of the parts for sector 4 of the interior of the Service Module. These parts
    │       include: Fuel Cells, Hydrogen Tank, Oxygen Tank. There is also a sub-folder contianing sub-assemblies
    │       of this section.
    ├── Storage Tank and Hardware/
    │     - Storage Tank along with its' top and mid securing plates.
    ├── Sump Tank and Hardware/
    │     - Sump Tank part along with its' top and mid securing plates.
    ├── _References/
    │     - This folder continas all of my research into finding reference material for the Saturn V Service and
    │       Command Module. There are also a few screenshots of the assemblies being created in Solid Edge
    │       sprinkled into this folder as well.
    └── _Renders/
        │ - Main renders of the final and sub-assemblies.
        └── Other Internal Pictures/
              - More renders of the service module that show of the insides.
    
    Update Images/
        - Contains a SolidEdge screenshot along with a drawing needed for the project update before final
          submission.
