# MAE 211 CSM Project
MAE 211 was an introduction to CAD class that I took. This repository contains my final project for this class which was the Saturn V Service module. This repo should contain all of the solid edge part files and assemblies for this project along with high resolution renders of the final project.

Renders can be found under SM/_Renders : https://github.com/SacredSqueegee/MAE_211_CSM_Project/tree/master/SM/_Renders
